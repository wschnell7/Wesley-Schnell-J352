                        The commissioner of Major League Baseball is always in demand, which makes it hard, these days,
                        to actually watch a game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For years, this was not a problem: Rob Manfred knew the natural breaks in the action — those
                        tedious, drawn-out, “just throw the ball already!” pauses — and could adjust his conversations
                        accordingly. Now, after a sweeping set of rule changes, his personal clock is off.
                    </p>

                        Street Journal)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Most of the time, I’m in a suite and I’ve got somebody talking at me about something,” Manfred
                        said late in spring training. “Prior to the change, the pace was such that you never really lost
                        track of the game. But the first couple of games, I’m like, ‘Can you please let me watch?’
                        Because you miss stuff.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The big changes, which come with the nuance typical of a complicated game, are the pitch clock,
                        a ban on the infield shift and limits on pickoff throws. A result, the league hopes, will be
                        crisper games packed with more hits, more stolen bases and more chances for players to use their
                        athleticism, especially on defense.

                        Under the current pitch timer rules in MiLB, there is a 14-second timer between pitches with no
                        one on base and 18 seconds with a runner on base (19 seconds in Triple-A). There is a 30-second
                        timer between batters. If a pitcher fails to throw a pitch in time, it is an automatic ball. If
                        a hitter is not ready in time, it is an automatic strike. Each batter gets one timeout per plate
                        appearance, and pitchers get a total of two step-offs or pickoffs per batter.

                        For the sake of comparison, in 2021, the nine-inning average in MiLB was an even three hours,
                        with 55% of games taking three hours or more to play. This year, only 10% of games have gone
                        that long. (In Major League Baseball this year, the average nine-inning game is taking 3:05.)

                            "We have a great game, but historically I think the game was a little crisper the way it
                            moved along, it had a little more action in it, more frequent balls in play, and getting
                            back to that form of baseball would be an improvement for us, for the players and for the
                            fans."

                        Players appear to have adjusted quickly to the new rules. There were 1.54 pitch-timer violations
                        per game the first week the rules were in effect, 1.19 the second, 0.93 the third and 0.68 the
                        fourth. During the game I attended, the only two times a pitcher even came close to violating
                        the timer came with a full count, but the pitch was delivered on time both times.

                        Yet that game, against the Seattle Mariners, was completed in 2 hours 29 minutes, and the
                        average time of spring training games, through Wednesday, was 2:35 — 26 minutes faster than last
                        spring. Stolen base attempts were up to 3.1 per 100 plate appearances, from 2.1, and so was the
                        success rate, which was 77.2 percent compared with last year’s 71.3.

                    <p>
                        Before, pitchers had unlimited opportunities to pick runners off. Now, they can disengage from
                        the rubber only twice per plate appearance; a third pickoff try, if unsuccessful, would result
                        in a balk. And with bigger bases (18 inches square, from 15), the distance between first and
                        second (and between second and third) is four and a half inches shorter than before.

                    <p>
                        “Putting aside pace of game — which obviously is going to be huge — I initially thought the
                        shift would have the biggest impact because it’s going to lead to less efficient positioning of
                        the defenders and therefore more balls getting through for hits,” Rick Hahn, the Chicago White
                        Sox’ general manager, said about halfway through the exhibition schedule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “But I’m starting to think it’s the bigger bases. We aren’t really known as a running team, and
                        I think we’re like 13 for 16 this spring. So teams that aren’t necessarily viewed as having that
                        as a big part of their arsenal, it’s going to be available to them on offense.”

                        The analytics era had many hallmarks. Stolen bases were rarely seen to be worth the risk, even
                        for the fastest players. Infielders were positioned in the most likely places that batters would
                        hit the ball, costing left-handed hitters, especially, countless hits. And if a batter or
                        pitcher needed a few extra seconds to gather his thoughts or recover from a high-stress
                        fastball, he could do so as often as he liked. Anything to optimize performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’s like, sorry, pitchers, but fans want to see base runners, they want to see first-to-third,
                        they want to see triples, they want to see home runs. They don’t want to see strikeouts and
                        nobody on base and 350 pitches thrown in a game.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teams must now keep two infielders on either side of second base, and infielders must keep both
                        feet on the dirt as the pitch is thrown. Players could turn more grounders into outs with the
                        shift in place, but few embraced the concept of playing out of position, which kept them from
                        using their instincts and showing off their range.
